A small, bash-like shell to practice threading, signal handling, and working in c. This shell supports three built in commands; exit, cd, and status. 
It also supports comments beginning with the '#' character, as well as the special symbols <, >, and &, which function the same as in bash. 

General syntax is: command [arg1 arg2 ...][< input file] [> output file] [&]


To compile/run: gcc -o smallsh smallsh.c, then enter smallsh on command line
